=====================
Python 2.7 Virtualenv
=====================
Prepare a virtual environment with Python 2.7 (I've been using Python 2.7.5).
The environment requires the following modules:

   * ete2 (2.2.1072)   <-- Requires lxml, MySQL-python, numpy, PyQt4
   * lxml (3.3.5)
   * MySQL-python (1.2.5)
   * numpy (1.8.1)
   * (PyQt4)    <-- Haven't gotten this to work: not essential.

Make sure to install ete2 as the last package, as it depends on all the others.

PyQt4
-----
To install PyQt4 you need to first make sure Qt4 is installed on the machine,
on my machine (Terra) it required the following packages from the RedHat
Server-6 repo:

  * qt (1:4.6.2-28)
  * qt-devel (1:4.6.2-28)
  * qt-sqlite (1:4.6.2-28)
  * qt-x11 (1:4.6.2-28)

They install the qmake binary as /usr/bin/qmake-qt4. Then follow instructions
at [1] to install SIP.  After SIP is installed, PyQt4 can be compiled and
installed as per instructions at [2]. It takes a long time to compile!
